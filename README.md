color memorization practice for the Hexcodle website made for use in love2d, to play enter your response in Hexcode as in "FFFFFF" for pure white and then enter to check the answer.

for the future:
1. add an input to change the amount of colors available (currently default it's 4^3 per channel)
2. give an extra chance on mistake
3. menus, possibly
4. other cleanup things
