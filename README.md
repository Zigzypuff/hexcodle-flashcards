color memorization practice for the Hexcodle website made for use in love2d, to play enter your response in Hexcode as in "FFFFFF" for pure white and then enter to check the answer.

for the future:
1. add an input to change the amount of colors available (currently default it's 4^3 per channel)
2. change window size
3. add score system or streak
4. show color guessed, possibly with extra chance similar to how hexcodle works
5. other cleanup things
